title: Laboratory 2
---

#### Task

In this Lab, we were tasked to create a carousel that contains 5 images. It was my first time creating a carousel using interactions in Figma.

Sir Ronron gave positive feedback on my carousel's colors and encouraged me to apply the theme from the previous laboratory.

<ImageContainer
  src={[
    '/ithci01/carousel.png',
    '/ithci01/profile2.png',
  ]}
  alt={[
    'Carousel',
    'Laboratory 1 Profile 2',
  ]}
/>
