title: Laboratory 2

#### Task

In this Lab, we were tasked to create a carousel that contains 5 images. It was my first time creating a carousel using interactions in Figma.

Sir Ronron gave positive feedback on my carousel's colors and encouraged me to apply the theme from the previous laboratory.
