### Input Requirements

- Full Name
- Age
- Grades in 3 Subjects (input as a list)
- Enrolled Courses (use a tuple: ex. ("Python", "Math", "AI"))

### Eligibility Criteria

- Average grade must >= 85
- Age must be between 18 and 25
- Must be enrolled in at least one of the required courses: `{"Python", "Math", "AI"}`

### Processing

- Calculate average using list of Grades
- Check for course match using set intersection
- Store all student info in a dictionary
- Use while loop to allow checking multiple students

### Output

- Display student details and scholarship eligibility message

### Code

```python title="lab1.py" lineNumbers
required_courses = {"Python", "AI", "Data Science"}

while True:
    name = str(input("Name: "))
    age = int(input("Age: "))
    grades = [float(input(f"Enter grade {i+1}: ")) for i in range(3)]
    enrolled = tuple(input("Enter a course enrolled (type 'done' to finish): ") for i in range(3))

    average = round(sum(grades) / len(grades), 2)
    eligible_courses = set(enrolled).intersection(set(required_courses))

    student = {
        "Name": name,
        "Age": age,
        "Average": average,
        "Courses": enrolled,
    }

    print("\nStudent Record:")
    for k, v in student.items():
        print(f"{k.capitalize()}: {v}")

    if average >= 85 and 18 <= age <= 25 and len(eligible_courses) >= 1:
        print("Eligible for scholarship.")
    else:
        print("Not eligible for scholarship.")

    again = input("\nCheck another student? (yes/no): ")
    if again.lower() != "yes":
        break
```
