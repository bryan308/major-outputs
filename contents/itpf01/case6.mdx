title: Case Problem 6
---

**score**: 28/30

Emily is a budding software developer who is working on a project for her school's math club. The club is organizing a competition where participants need to calculate the areas of different geometric shapes to determine the amount of paint needed for art projects. Emily decides to create a Java application called ShapeAreaCalculator that can compute the areas of three shapes: rectangles, triangles, and circles.

To complete her application, she needs to implement the following features using Java methods:

**Rectangle Area**: The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:

`Area=length×width`

Create a method named calculateRectangleArea that takes two parameters (length and width) and returns the calculated area.

**Triangle Area**: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

`Area=1/2×base×height`

Create a method named calculateTriangleArea that takes two parameters (base and height) and returns the calculated area.

**Circle Area**: The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula:

`Area=π×radius`

Create a method named calculateCircleArea that takes one parameter (radius) and returns the calculated area.

Emily also wants to include a feature that allows users to input the dimensions of each shape and view the calculated area. She plans to display the results in a user-friendly manner.

**Questions**

1. Write the Java methods that Emily needs to implement for calculating the areas of a rectangle, triangle, and circle.
2. How would you design the main method to allow users to input the dimensions for each shape and call the corresponding methods to display the results?
3. If a user inputs the following dimensions:

**Rectangle**: length = 4, width = 5

**Triangle**: base = 6, height = 3

**Circle**: radius = 2. What will be the calculated areas for each shape?

**Expected Outcomes**

By solving this problem, students will demonstrate their understanding of Java methods, including how to create methods with parameters, return values, and method calling within a Java application. Additionally, students will practice problem-solving skills by translating real-world scenarios into code.
