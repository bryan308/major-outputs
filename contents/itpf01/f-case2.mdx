**score**: 40/50

You are tasked with creating a Java program that calculates an employeeâ€™s the total compensation consists of the base salary, a performance-based bonus, and additional department-based benefits.

- **Employee** Role: The program must first check the role of the employee. Roles can be:
- **Manager**: Base salary of $80,000.
- **Developer**: Base salary of $60,000.
- **Intern**: Base salary of $30,000.

**Years of Service**:

- Employees with 10 or more years of service receive a 5% bonus on their base salary.
- Employees with 5 to 9 years of service receive a 3% bonus.
- Employees with less than 5 years of service receive no bonus

**Department-Specific Benefits**:
- Employees in the IT Department receive an additional $5,000 benefit.
- Employees in the HR Department receive an additional $3,000 benefit.
- Employees in the Sales Department receive an additional $7,000 benefit.
- Employees in other departments receive $2,000 benefit.

If an employee is an intern, they are not eligible for any bonus, regardless of their years of service. However, they still receive the department-specific benefits.

The program should display the employee's base salary, bonus (if applicable), department benefit, and the final total compensation.

```console
Sample output 1:
Enter employee role (Manager, Developer, Intern): Manager
Enter years of service: 12
Enter department (IT, HR, Sales, Other): HR

Base Salary: $80,000.00
Bonus: $4,000.00
Department Benefit: $3,000.00
Total Compensation: $87,000.00

Sample output 2:
Enter employee role (Manager, Developer, Intern): Intern
Enter years of service: 6
Enter department (IT, HR, Sales, Other): Sales

Base Salary: $30,000.00
Bonus: $0.00
Department Benefit: $7,000.00
Total Compensation: $37,000.00
```
