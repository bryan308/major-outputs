### Problem

A store wants to manage its inventory of products across 3 branches.

Write a program that will:

1. Use a 2D array to store the stock quantities of each product in each branch.
2. Allow the user to input the stock quantities for all products in all branches.
3. Display the stock quantities in a tabular format.

Calculate and display:

**Total stock of each product across all branches**.

**Totak stock in each branch**.

**The overall stock in the store**.

### Code

```java title="Case1.java"
package case1;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Case1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object for input
        int[][] stock = new int[4][3]; // 2D array to store stock quantities for 4 branches and 3 products

        // Input stock quantities
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            System.out.println("Enter stock quantities for Branch " + (branch + 1) + ":");
            for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
                System.out.print("Product " + (product + 1) + ": ");
                stock[branch][product] = kb.nextInt(); // Read stock quantity for the current product in the current branch
            }
        }
        // Display stock quantities in tabular format
        System.out.println("\nStock quantities:");
        System.out.println("Branch\tProduct 1\tProduct 2\tProduct 3");
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            System.out.print("Branch " + (branch + 1) + "\t");
            for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
                System.out.print(stock[branch][product] + "\t\t"); // Print stock quantity for the current product in the current branch
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after printing all products for the current branch
        }
        // Calculate and display total stock of each product across all branches
        int[] totalProductStock = new int[3]; // Array to store total stock for each product
        for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
            for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
                totalProductStock[product] += stock[branch][product]; // Add stock quantity of the current product from the current branch to the total
            }
        }
        System.out.println("\nTotal stock of each product across all branches:");
        for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
            System.out.println("Product " + (product + 1) + ": " + totalProductStock[product]); // Print total stock for the current product
        }
        // Calculate and display total stock in each branch
        int[] totalBranchStock = new int[4]; // Array to store total stock for each branch
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
                totalBranchStock[branch] += stock[branch][product]; // Add stock quantity of the current product froma the current branch to the total
            }
        }
        System.out.println("\nTotal stock in each branch:");
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            System.out.println("Branch " + (branch + 1) + ": " + totalBranchStock[branch]); // Print total stock for the current branch
        }
        // Calculate and display the overall stock in the store
        int overallStock = 0; // Variable to store overall stock
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            for (int product = 0; product < 3; product++) { // Loop through each product
                overallStock += stock[branch][product]; // Add total stock of the current branch to the overall stock
            }
        }
        System.out.println("\nOverall stock in the store: " + overallStock); // Print overall stock

        kb.close(); // Close the Scanner object
    }
}
```

### Sample Ouput

```console
$ java case1_angulo.Case1
Enter stock quantities for Branch 1:
Product 1: 80
Product 2: 34
Product 3: 75
Enter stock quantities for Branch 2:
Product 1: 34
Product 2: 76
Product 3: 56
Enter stock quantities for Branch 3:
Product 1: 89
Product 2: 67
Product 3: 56
Enter stock quantities for Branch 4:
Product 1: 90
Product 2: 75
Product 3: 45

Stock quantities:
Branch  Product 1       Product 2       Product 3
Branch 1        80              34              75
Branch 2        34              76              56
Branch 3        89              67              56
Branch 4        90              75              45

Total stock of each product across all branches:
Product 1: 293
Product 2: 252
Product 3: 232

Total stock in each branch:
Branch 1: 189
Branch 2: 166
Branch 3: 212
Branch 4: 210

Overall stock in the store: 777
